Exciting news! Pallad is now in closed beta.

What does this mean? Well, we've started to let people use Pallad & gather their feedback. There’s a list of hundreds of people on the beta testing waiting list who will soon be receiving installation instructions. If you’ve not signed up yet, don’t worry you can still do so on at https://pallad.xyz/.

## What is Pallad?
Pallad is a zero-knowledge focused non-custodial browser extension wallet. Pallad will not only allow seamless interaction with zkApps but also give users the power to store credentials, and utilize zero-knowledge features such as attesting to private data. 

## The Power of Open Source Software
Pallad’s codebase is open source and always will be. Open source is important because transparency not only accelerates innovation and improvement but also ensures a higher level of security as more eyes scrutinize the code. Moreover, open source software promotes accessibility and equality in technology, allowing anyone, regardless of their resources, to use, modify, and distribute the software. By embracing this ethos, Pallad empowers its users and community developers, driving forward a community-led development that resonates with their needs and aspirations of its users. Building Pallad’s relationship with the ecosystem is Paramount, if you have ideas let’s hear them, let’s build together!

## So… what’s coming next?
First, testing the wallet with the waitlist volunteers. Their feedback will be invaluable. This phase should last a few weeks until we feel confident enough to launch the Open Beta Phase where all waitlist participants can get involved.

## What's in Pallad’s Beta version?
Keeping it simple, the beta will allow you to make transactions and funds on Berkeley. There's a transaction history and an address book. That’s what you’ll see on the surface, under the hood there’s a few libraries that standardize how the wallet interacts with Mina, derives address, creates credentials, and manages keys.

## Upcoming features — Short-Term
Web Provider RPC allowing zkApps to interact with Pallad (similar to EVM chains). Hardware wallets, most likely Ledger. Internationalization (starting with Turkish, of course ❤️). Protokit. Zeko. 

## Upcoming Features - Mid-Term
Pallad’s engine is already capable of quite a few things that will get ironed out in the mid-term:
multi-chain - multi-mnemonic - multi-account - multi-address HD derivation — we want to make that multi^4 experience shine.
Credential management for your digital identity & usage with zkApps.
Browser node integration so you can send the transaction without 3rd parties.
Native tokens and NFT related features.

## Upcoming Features - Long-Term
Integrations with other blockchains like Optimism, Aleo, and Sui, maybe some zkEVMs. Mobile wallet. On Ramp & Off Ramp. zkApp Store.
